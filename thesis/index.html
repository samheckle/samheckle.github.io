      a ritual to interface with randomness as a godlike entity, where both the
      participant and computer consume procedurally generated content that is
      presented as a digital, non-linear zine.

    <h4>wtf are you on about</h4>
    <p>
      Humans have an innate tendency to explore, classify, and catalog
      information of their own experiences. By telling stories about the lives
      we are living, we live outside of ourselves – these externalizations of
      our interiorities simultaneously connect us to the world and disconnect us
      from ourselves. Social media is a contemporary channel through which we
      share our selves and our stories. The connectedness that the current
      Internet has allowed for has become irreversible, and checking our screens
      has become a daily routine. In online spaces, we are classified with
      labels that create barriers between ourselves and others. We are given
      content that the algorithm classifies as good for us. This randomness in
      how we see and interact with online content is fascinating.<span class="q"> Are our
      classifications random or are they truly a reflection of who we are? Is it
      fate we saw a particular piece of media and it resonated with us?</span> My
      proclamation is this: there is no boundary between fate and randomness,
      they coexist yet we only acknowledge the former. Fate is random.
      Algorithms are rituals. My proposition is to create a ritual where an
      observer can interact with randomness on a transcendent level.
